    "__Q1) What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases ?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database systems. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with a pre-defined structure, and use SQL for querying and manipulating the data. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use a pre-defined schema and can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs or documents. They typically use their own query language or API for data retrieval and manipulation."

    "DROP TABLE customers; <br>\n",

    "* __ALTER:__ This statement is used to modify the structure of a database object. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column \"phone\" to the \"customers\" table: <br>\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers ADD phone VARCHAR(20); <br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of DML statements and their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __INSERT:__ This statement is used to insert new data into a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into the \"customers\" table with values for the \"name\" and \"email\" columns: <br>\n",

    "INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('Shehryar Gondal', 'ShehryarGondal@example.com'); <br>\n",

    "__Code__:\n",
    "UPDATE customers SET email = 'jsmith@example.com' WHERE id = 1; <br>\n",

    "__Q6) Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ In this code, the mysql.connector module is used to connect to a MySQL database. The connect() method is used to establish a connection to the database, and the cursor() method is used to create a cursor object. The execute() method is then called on the cursor object to execute a SQL query. Finally, the fetchall() method is called to fetch the results of the query, which are printed to the console using a for loop. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cursor() method returns a cursor object, which is used to interact with the database. The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries, fetch results, and manipulate data in the database.<br>\n",
